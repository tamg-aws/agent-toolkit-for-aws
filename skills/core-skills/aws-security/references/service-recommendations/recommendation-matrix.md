# Pass 3 — Inventory to Service Recommendation Matrix

Workload rows require discovered resources or confirmed use; baseline and organization
rows require their stated conditions. Apply gaps only to validated negative evidence,
not UNKNOWN or NOT ASSESSED checks. Record NOT APPLICABLE when irrelevance is verified.

## Baseline: account activity and stated conditions

These use account activity plus the row-specific conditions rather than a workload trigger.

| Recommendation | Priority | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| GuardDuty foundational (CloudTrail, VPC flow, DNS analysis) | **Critical** | Threat detection with no data-source configuration; pulls streams directly |
| AWS Config recorder, **when Security Hub CSPM runs standalone** | **Critical** | Standalone CSPM uses your recorder for most controls. With unified Security Hub also enabled, CSPM manages the service-linked recorder `AWSConfigurationRecorderForSecurityHubCSPM` and this row does not apply |
| Security Hub CSPM with FSBP | **Critical** | Baseline posture standard; the guide's starting point |
| IAM Access Analyzer external-access analyzer | **High** | Surfaces unintended external access to resources |
| Cross-region finding aggregation, when more than one region is in use | **High** | Regional services produce fragmented findings otherwise |

## Triggered by compute

| Trigger from pass 1 | Recommend | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Any EC2 instance | GuardDuty `EBS_MALWARE_PROTECTION` | High |
| Any EC2 instance | Inspector `EC2` scanning through Enhanced EC2 Scanning (the VM Scanner), not the legacy SSM plugin | High |
| EC2 instance, SSM-managed | GuardDuty `RUNTIME_MONITORING` with `EC2_AGENT_MANAGEMENT` | High |
| EC2 instance, **not** SSM-managed, Runtime Monitoring wanted | Default Host Management Configuration via SSM Quick Setup first; GuardDuty EC2 agent management requires SSM | High |
| Any EC2 instance | Inspector Deep Inspection (Linux, Windows, and macOS with Enhanced EC2 Scanning) | Medium |
| Any Lambda function | Inspector `LAMBDA` **and** `LAMBDA_CODE` | High |
| Any Lambda function | GuardDuty `LAMBDA_NETWORK_LOGS` | Medium |
| Bedrock, Bedrock AgentCore, or SageMaker AI in use | GuardDuty `AI_PROTECTION` | High |

For scanner/coverage nuances, read [runtime and workload coverage](detection-and-vulnerability.md#runtime-and-workload-coverage).

## Triggered by containers

| Trigger from pass 1 | Recommend | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Any ECR repository | Inspector `ECR` scanning, continuous | High |
| ECR repository with images | ECR rescan duration tuned to build cadence | Medium |
| Any EKS cluster | GuardDuty `EKS_AUDIT_LOGS` | High |
| EKS cluster on EC2 nodegroups | GuardDuty `RUNTIME_MONITORING` with `EKS_ADDON_MANAGEMENT` | High |
| EKS cluster, Fargate profiles only | **Do not** recommend Runtime Monitoring — unsupported | n/a |
| ECS cluster on Fargate | GuardDuty `RUNTIME_MONITORING` with `ECS_FARGATE_AGENT_MANAGEMENT` | High |
| ECS cluster on EC2 | GuardDuty `RUNTIME_MONITORING`; the agent on the container instances follows the EC2 path per the guide's linked prerequisites, not an automated ECS setting | High |
| Any EKS cluster | Security Lake `EKS_AUDIT` source | Medium |
| EKS cluster | Detective for cross-account container visibility | Medium |

For agent rollout or image relevance, read [runtime and workload coverage](detection-and-vulnerability.md#runtime-and-workload-coverage).

## Triggered by data

| Trigger from pass 1 | Recommend | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Any S3 bucket | GuardDuty `S3_DATA_EVENTS` | High |
| Any S3 bucket | Macie automated sensitive data discovery | High |
| Macie enabled | Classification export to S3 within 30 days | High |
| Macie enabled, sensitive data findings not published to Security Hub CSPM | Enable publishing so Security Hub exposure scoring and GuardDuty attack sequences see sensitive-data traits | High |
| S3 bucket taking untrusted or third-party uploads | GuardDuty S3 Malware Protection, **per bucket** | High |
| Many or large S3 buckets | Automated discovery over discovery jobs | Medium |
| Dataset requiring full coverage, not sampling | Targeted discovery job in addition | Medium |
| RDS / Aurora database meeting current supported engine/version and applicable prerequisites | GuardDuty `RDS_LOGIN_EVENTS` | High |
| Backup vaults protecting recovery-critical workloads (EBS snapshots, AMIs, S3 recovery points) | Malware Protection for AWS Backup, those vaults first | Medium |

For RDS eligibility or selective malware scope, read [AI and malware scope](detection-and-vulnerability.md#ai-and-malware-scope).
For discovery completeness or export evidence, read the relevant [Macie decision](data-discovery.md#assurance-and-scanability).

## Triggered by network and edge

| Trigger from pass 1 | Recommend | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Internet-facing ALB **not** behind CloudFront, no WebACL | AWS WAF — route to the `waf` skill | **Critical** |
| CloudFront distribution with application logic behind it, no WebACL | AWS WAF at the CloudFront layer — route to the `waf` skill | **Critical** |
| ALB behind CloudFront with a distribution WebACL and verified origin access restrictions | Distribution protection may suffice; do not automatically duplicate WAF on the ALB | n/a |
| CloudFront serving only static cached content, no WebACL | Informational; the guide calls WAF here uncommon and low value | Low |
| Internal ALB, no WebACL | n/a unless it indirectly handles unfiltered traffic from a network you do not control | n/a |
| API Gateway REST API not behind CloudFront, no WebACL | AWS WAF — route to the `waf` skill | High |
| Internet-facing NLB or non-HTTP ingress with an established traffic-inspection requirement | Evaluate Network Firewall for that requirement; presence alone is not a gap. Shield Advanced follows its own row | Medium |
| Confirmed public or private application needing AppSec assessment | Evaluate AWS Security Agent through [application fit and scope](application-security.md#application-fit-and-scope); conditional AppSec-owner handoff | Low |
| VPC with no DNS Firewall rule group association | Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall with AWS-managed lists — route to the `route53` skill | High |
| DNS Firewall associated, no query logging | Enable Resolver query logging | Medium |
| DNS Firewall associated, Advanced rules off | DNS Firewall Advanced for tunneling and DGA detection | Medium |
| Any VPC | Security Lake default sources `VPC_FLOW` and `ROUTE53`; no flow-log or query-log prerequisite | Medium |
| Revenue-generating internet-facing workload on CloudFront, ALB, EIP, Global Accelerator, or Route 53, where downtime cost exceeds the subscription | Shield Advanced, verifying current WAF/Firewall Manager bundled eligibility — route to the `shieldadvanced` skill. CloudFront L3/L4 volumetric protection is already AWS's responsibility | Medium |
| Egress traffic needing L3-L7 inspection | Network Firewall | Medium |
| Network Firewall deployed, observed rule order conflicts with the verified intended policy strategy | Review strict-order suitability and rule dependencies with the firewall owner; establish the intended strategy before recommending a change | High (verified gap only) |
| Network Firewall deployed, default actions do not meet demonstrated enforcement or logging requirements under the selected compatible strategy | Review application-aware versus custom defaults and observed verdict/log evidence; do not universally pair drop and alert defaults or infer enforcement from configuration | High (verified gap only) |
| Network Firewall deployed, stream-exception behavior conflicts with application recovery requirements | Review the selected policy against application recovery, active connections and idle-flow evidence; assess planned change impact with the owner rather than assuming a universal restart | High (verified gap only) |
| Network Firewall deployed, endpoint coverage does not meet the verified deployment mode and traffic-path requirements | Review topology-specific endpoint/AZ coverage for inspection-VPC, native TGW or multi-endpoint mode; recommend changes only for a demonstrated path requirement | High (verified gap only) |
| Network Firewall deployed, no logging configuration | Enable ALERT and FLOW logs, to separate destinations | Medium |
| 10+ accounts with **distributed** WAF, DNS Firewall, or Network Firewall deployments (per account or per VPC) | Firewall Manager for policy rollout and enforcement; requires Organizations and AWS Config; verify current pricing and Shield Advanced bundled eligibility. Limited value for a centralized single-firewall design | Medium |

For the conditional Network Firewall rows, unresolved topology, intent or compatibility
is an UNKNOWN evidence disposition, not a recommendation priority. Assign High only
to a verified gap; unassessed or advisory-only decisions have no gap priority.

For origin bypass, read [endpoint coverage](web-protection.md#endpoint-coverage-and-bypass); for inspection paths, read [routed inspection](network-firewall.md#routed-inspection-and-policy).

## Triggered by certificates

| Trigger from pass 1 | Recommend | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Certificate estate with demonstrated unmet monitoring coverage, delivery or lead-time needs after evaluating the chosen monitoring method | Close the verified monitoring gap; EventBridge expiry routing to SNS is an option only when event applicability and unmet needs justify it. Adequate CloudWatch alarms or issuer-side checks require no duplicate route; unknown monitoring stays UNKNOWN | High (verified gap only) |
| Certificate with `Type: IMPORTED` | Renewal automation (the guide's pattern is an AWS Config rule plus Lambda); ACM does not renew imports. Verify expiration monitoring separately | High |
| Certificate issued via Private CA `IssueCertificate` | Separate renewal and expiration monitoring; verify ACM representation and event applicability before proposing ACM event routing | High |
| ACM-requested public/private certificate with renewal eligibility or state unresolved | Record renewal evidence as UNKNOWN; verify issuance path, `RenewalEligibility` and available renewal status; do not infer failure from `Type: PRIVATE` | n/a |
| Email-validated certificate | Migrate to DNS validation for automatic renewal | Medium |
| Certificate with `InUse: false` | Review and remove — unused certs count against quota | Low |
| `DaysBeforeExpiry` at default 45 | Confirm 45 days suits the renewal process; range is 1-45 | Low |
| Private CA present or PKI architecture requested | Assess [trust domains and root isolation](certificates.md#trust-domains-and-root-isolation) against issuing requirements; no fixed depth gate | Medium (verified gap only) |
| Internal hostnames in a public certificate | Consider disabling Certificate Transparency logging | Low |

ACM cannot be "enabled" — it is always available. These are monitoring gaps rather than
enablement gaps, and the priority reflects that an unmonitored expiry is an outage, not a
breach.

## Triggered by organization context

### Standards hygiene

Triggered by pass 2 rather than pass 1 — these are findings about how enabled standards
are configured.

| Observed in pass 2 | Recommend | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Unified Security Hub enabled **and** CSPM still ingesting AWS service or third-party findings that Security Hub already aggregates | Duplicate ingestion — audit EventBridge, SIEM, ticketing, and Lambda consumers first, then disable that ingestion in CSPM. Keep Macie publishing to CSPM (it is how sensitive-data traits reach Security Hub) and keep the cross-region finding aggregator, which central configuration requires | Medium |
| Unified Security Hub enabled, Threat Analytics off | Consider Threat Analytics for production so GuardDuty detections appear beside the misconfigurations that enabled them | Medium |
| Unified Security Hub not enabled, CSPM only | Evaluate unified Security Hub for exposure findings and attack path analysis | Medium |
| PCI DSS v3.2.1 enabled | Migrate to v4.0.1; the guide lists both versions, and the PCI SSC retirement of v3.2.1 is external context, not guide-sourced | High |
| PCI DSS v3.2.1 **and** v4.0.1 both enabled | Retire v3.2.1 once coverage is compared; verify pricing before claiming duplicate charges | Medium |
| CIS below v5.0.0 enabled | Plan migration to v5.0.0; both may run during transition | Medium |
| FSBP v1.0.0 with no other standard | Layer standards per business requirement | Low |
| `AutoEnableStandards: NONE` under **local** configuration | New accounts get no standards — set to `DEFAULT` | High |
| Central configuration `ENABLED` with `AutoEnable: false` or `AutoEnableStandards: NONE` | Expected field values under central configuration; verify policy association/application and member coverage separately, or report those UNKNOWN | n/a |
| Security Hub CSPM enabled, Security Lake in use without `SH_FINDINGS` | Security Lake `SH_FINDINGS` source | Medium |

The guide's transition guidance is to enable both versions simultaneously to compare
coverage, then retire the old one. Flag a long-lived overlap, not the overlap itself.

### Organization posture

| Trigger from pass 1 | Recommend | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| More than one member account | Delegated administrator per service in the security tooling account | **Critical** |
| Security Lake in use | Delegated administrator in the **Log Archive** account | High |
| Members enrolled, auto-enable off under local configuration | Auto-enable for new accounts | **Critical** |
| Inspector config drift concern | AWS Organizations Inspector policy | High |
| Per-account Security Hub setup | Central configuration policy | High |
| Multi-region organization trail present | Security Lake `CLOUD_TRAIL_MGMT` | Medium |
| No multi-region org trail | Create one before recommending Security Lake CloudTrail source | High |
| GuardDuty enabled, no log-correlation tooling | Detective | Medium |
| More than 1200 accounts | Note the Detective behavior graph quota | Medium |

Delegated administrator placement per the Security Reference Architecture: GuardDuty,
Security Hub, Inspector, Macie, and Detective in one security tooling account; Security
Lake in the Log Archive account. With Control Tower, that is the existing Audit or
Security account. Flag any divergence.

## Priority assignment

- **Critical** — no threat detection or posture baseline at all; org-wide coverage gap
  that grows with every new account; internet-facing HTTP resource with application logic
  and no L7 protection
- **High** — a deployed resource type has no corresponding detection; a prerequisite for
  an enabled service is missing; findings are fragmented across regions
- **Medium** — coverage exists but is untuned; a defense-in-depth service is absent;
  cost optimization available without losing visibility
- **Low** — configuration polish; documentation of accepted risk

## Report format

Summarize scope, evidence completion, and limitations first. Use counts and masked
identifiers by default; identifier disclosure requires an explicit request, and raw
responses require an explicit raw-output request. Never include credentials, account
emails, target payloads, or secret origin headers, even in requested raw output.
Recommendation priorities below are workflow-authored; preserve source findings severity
and AttackSequence/Exposure-first ordering in separate findings summaries.

For each recommendation:

```
[PRIORITY] <Service or plan>
  Justified by:  <resource/count or verified account/activity condition; account/region scope>
  Current state: OBSERVED <configuration/coverage> | NOT ENABLED (validated) | UNKNOWN <reason> | NOT ASSESSED | NOT APPLICABLE | ADVISORY
  Guide section: <guide page> | n/a (not guide-sourced)
  Cost note:     <free trial, usage page, or billing consideration>
  Advisory action: <proposed change in prose>
  Handoff:       <separate implementation workflow for an accepted recommendation>
```

`Guide section: n/a` is correct and expected for IAM Access Analyzer, the
`AutoEnableOrganizationMembers: ALL` pass condition, the DNS Firewall fail-open check, the
PCI DSS v3.2.1 retirement fact, and the priority ranking itself. AWS Config cites the CSPM
guide's standalone case. Do not invent a citation to fill the field — an unsourced
recommendation labelled as such is more useful than a fabricated reference.

## Focused suitability beyond enablement

For a confirmed need below, read the linked file and relevant section **before resolving
that decision**. Load only relevant sections, not every domain. Existing protections and
planned workloads can trigger these decisions; inventory alone cannot establish the need.
