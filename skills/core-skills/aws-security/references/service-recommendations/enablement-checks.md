# Pass 2 — Security Service Enablement Checks

All commands are read-only. Run relevant sections in the assessed scope, reusing complete
observations. External-access analyzers need regional evidence; unused-access findings do
not vary by region. Preserve evidence states as defined in ../service-recommendations.md, including validated
not-enabled responses. Parent-service enablement does not prove effective workload coverage.
If a pass condition has no available read evidence, report it UNKNOWN or seek focused manual
evidence; do not invent a check or label it passed.

Only with an explicit request for detailed account-level enumeration, reconcile complete
member IDs/status with scoped ACTIVE IDs from inventory, following all pages. Broad
coverage audits or service recommendations alone do not authorize member enumeration.
Prefer available statistics/counts; mark unrequested detail NOT ASSESSED. Apply this gate
to every member read below and any Security Lake per-member source checks or account-bearing
source listings. Do not run unbounded source listings for org-wide member discovery.
Missing permissions/pages in authorized reads leave the remainder UNKNOWN. Membership and
central-policy association are separate evidence; listing policies proves neither coverage
nor successful application.

## Amazon GuardDuty

```bash
# Detector presence. Empty list = not enabled in this region.
aws guardduty list-detectors --region <region>

# Per-feature status. Checking the detector alone is not sufficient — protection plans
# are individually toggled.
aws guardduty get-detector --detector-id <id> --region <region>
```

`get-detector` returns `Features[]` with a `Name` and `Status` per plan.

`Features[]` also includes the foundational sources `CLOUD_TRAIL`, `DNS_LOGS`, and
`FLOW_LOGS`. These are always `ENABLED` on an active detector and are not protection plans;
they cannot be toggled, so do not report them as gaps. VPC flow and DNS analysis are still
metered per GB; apply the parent workflow cost rules.

Optional protection plans, which are the ones worth checking:

| Feature | Covers | Applies when inventory shows |
|---|---|---|
| `S3_DATA_EVENTS` | CloudTrail S3 data events | Any S3 bucket |
| `EKS_AUDIT_LOGS` | EKS audit logs | Any EKS cluster |
| `EBS_MALWARE_PROTECTION` | EBS volume malware scanning | EC2 instances with EBS volumes |
| `RDS_LOGIN_EVENTS` | Supported RDS / Aurora login activity | Engine/version and prerequisites verified against the current [supported-database table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/rds-protection.html#rds-pro-supported-db); unresolved eligibility is UNKNOWN |
| `LAMBDA_NETWORK_LOGS` | Lambda network activity | Any Lambda function |
| `RUNTIME_MONITORING` | EC2, ECS, EKS runtime | EC2, ECS, or EKS on EC2 |
| `EKS_RUNTIME_MONITORING` | EKS runtime (superseded by `RUNTIME_MONITORING`) | EKS on EC2 |
| `AI_PROTECTION` | CloudTrail data events from Bedrock, Bedrock AgentCore, and SageMaker AI, plus management events | Bedrock, AgentCore, or SageMaker AI in use |
| `AI_ANALYST` | GuardDuty Investigation (AI-powered finding analysis; preview; verify current region eligibility) | Optional; any account in a supported region |

Runtime Monitoring has an `AdditionalConfiguration` array for agent management:
`EC2_AGENT_MANAGEMENT`, `ECS_FARGATE_AGENT_MANAGEMENT`, `EKS_ADDON_MANAGEMENT`. The guide
recommends letting GuardDuty manage agents so new resources are covered automatically.

```bash
# Runtime Monitoring agent coverage — enabled but uncovered is a silent gap.
# Returns null Resources when RUNTIME_MONITORING is DISABLED; that is expected,
# not an error. Check the feature status first and skip this call if disabled.
aws guardduty list-coverage --detector-id <id> --region <region> \
  --filter-criteria '{"FilterCriterion":[{"CriterionKey":"ACCOUNT_ID","FilterCondition":{"Equals":["<caller-account-id>"]}}]}' \
  --query 'Resources[].{Account:AccountId,Resource:ResourceId,Type:ResourceDetails.ResourceType,Status:CoverageStatus,Issue:Issue}'

# S3 Malware Protection plans — enabled per bucket, not per detector. Malware Protection
# for AWS Backup has no read API; confirm it in the console.
aws guardduty list-malware-protection-plans --region <region>

# Organization posture. Both calls raise BadRequestException / InvalidInputException
# from a non-admin account — see Troubleshooting in ../service-recommendations.md.
aws guardduty list-organization-admin-accounts --region <region>
aws guardduty describe-organization-configuration --detector-id <id> --region <region>
# ONLY when detailed account-level enumeration is explicitly requested.
aws guardduty list-members --detector-id <id> \
  --query 'Members[].{Id:AccountId,Status:RelationshipStatus}' --region <region>
```

`describe-organization-configuration` returns `AutoEnableOrganizationMembers` with values
`NEW`, `ALL`, or `NONE`. `ALL` covers existing and new accounts and is what the guide's
reference Terraform uses; the guide itself presents the three options without ranking them,
so this skill's pass condition of `ALL` is its own design. `NEW` leaves existing accounts
uncovered; `NONE` means manual management.

**Pass conditions:** detector exists; every feature whose triggering resource is present
is `ENABLED`; `AutoEnableOrganizationMembers` is `ALL` in an org; finding publishing
frequency tightened from the 6-hour default (15 minutes if Detective is in use); S3 Malware
Protection plans exist for the buckets identified as taking untrusted uploads.

## AWS Security Hub CSPM

```bash
# Not enabled raises ResourceNotFoundException
aws securityhub describe-hub --region <region>

# Which standards are on. FSBP is the baseline; layer others per requirement.
aws securityhub get-enabled-standards --region <region>

# Cross-region aggregation
aws securityhub list-finding-aggregators --region <region>
aws securityhub get-finding-aggregator --finding-aggregator-arn <arn> --region <region>

# Central configuration — preferred over per-account setup
aws securityhub list-configuration-policies --region <region>

# Organization posture
aws securityhub list-organization-admin-accounts --region <region>
aws securityhub describe-organization-configuration --region <region>
# ONLY when detailed account-level enumeration is explicitly requested.
aws securityhub list-members --no-only-associated \
  --query 'Members[].{Id:AccountId,Status:MemberStatus}' --region <region>
```

Standard versions per the guide: CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark supports v1.2.0, v1.4.0,
v3.0.0, v5.0.0 — new adopters should start at **v5.0.0**. PCI DSS supports v3.2.1 and
v4.0.1; the guide lists both, and the PCI SSC's retirement of v3.2.1 (external context, not
guide-sourced) is why in-scope orgs need v4.0.1. NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 and NIST SP 800-171
Rev. 2 are available, the latter for CUI handling, as are the AI Security Best Practices
standard and the AWS Resource Tagging Standard.

**Pass conditions:** hub enabled; FSBP enabled at minimum; a finding aggregator exists if
more than one region is in use; central configuration policy in place for orgs; a
customer-managed AWS Config recorder present **only if CSPM runs standalone** (see AWS
Config below).

## AWS Security Hub (unified)

Distinct from CSPM. The older product was rebranded Security Hub CSPM; today's Security
Hub is a unified platform that correlates GuardDuty, Inspector, Macie, and CSPM signals
into exposure findings and attack paths. Both can be enabled at once, and both live in the
`securityhub` API namespace — the unified service uses the `*V2` operations.

```bash
# Unified Security Hub. ResourceNotFoundException / ResourceConflictException = not enabled.
aws securityhub describe-security-hub-v2 --region <region>

# Unified aggregation
aws securityhub list-aggregators-v2 --region <region>
```

**Cross-cutting finding:** if unified Security Hub is enabled **and** CSPM is still
ingesting AWS service or third-party findings that Security Hub already aggregates, you may
be paying for the same aggregation twice. The guide's lever is disabling that finding
ingestion in CSPM, not removing the cross-region finding aggregator, which central
configuration requires. Before recommending it, the guide is explicit that you must audit
EventBridge rules, SIEM feeds, ticketing workflows, and custom Lambda functions and confirm
each reads from Security Hub, because disabling ingestion without checking dependencies
"breaks alerting quietly". Keep Macie publishing to CSPM: that is how sensitive-data traits
reach Security Hub exposure scoring.

Verify current plans, pricing and inclusion using the parent cost-review rules.

**Policies vs deployments:** Organizations policies exist for Security Hub and Inspector
and auto-apply to new accounts, preventing drift. GuardDuty and CSPM use one-time
deployments that cannot be viewed or edited and do **not** cover newly enabled accounts —
so GuardDuty and locally configured CSPM still need auto-enable for new members. Under
CSPM central configuration, false/NONE auto-enable fields are expected; verify policy
association/application and member coverage separately, or report them UNKNOWN.

**Pass conditions:** enabled in the delegated admin's home region; no duplicate finding
ingestion in CSPM once consumers are confirmed on Security Hub; Threat Analytics considered
for production accounts.

## AWS Certificate Manager

ACM is always available rather than something you enable, so the checks here are
monitoring and configuration hygiene.

```bash
# Certificate inventory with expiry and in-use status
aws acm list-certificates \
  --includes keyTypes=RSA_1024,RSA_2048,RSA_3072,RSA_4096,EC_prime256v1,EC_secp384r1,EC_secp521r1 \
  --query 'CertificateSummaryList[].{Arn:CertificateArn,Domain:DomainName,Status:Status,NotAfter:NotAfter,InUse:InUse,Type:Type}' \
  --region <region>

# Expiry notification window. ACM emits daily EventBridge events starting
# DaysBeforeExpiry out; valid range is 1-45, default 45.
aws acm get-account-configuration --region <region>

# Per-certificate detail — renewal eligibility and Certificate Transparency preference
aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn <arn> \
  --query 'Certificate.{Arn:CertificateArn,Type:Type,Status:Status,RenewalEligibility:RenewalEligibility,RenewalStatus:RenewalSummary.RenewalStatus,Validation:DomainValidationOptions[].ValidationMethod,Options:Options,InUseBy:InUseBy,NotBefore:NotBefore,NotAfter:NotAfter}' \
  --region <region>

# Inspect default-bus expiry rules and selected SNS target ARNs, without target payloads
aws events list-rules --event-bus-name default \
  --query 'Rules[].{Name:Name,State:State,EventPattern:EventPattern}' --region <region>
aws events list-targets-by-rule --rule <rule-name> --event-bus-name default \
  --query 'Targets[].{Id:Id,Arn:Arn}' --region <region>

# Private CA
aws acm-pca list-certificate-authorities \
  --query 'CertificateAuthorities[].{Arn:Arn,Type:Type,Status:Status}' --region <region>
```

**Pass conditions:** the chosen monitoring method demonstrates coverage of the relevant
certificate estate, successful notification delivery and adequate renewal lead time
(see the [matrix](recommendation-matrix.md#triggered-by-certificates)). Accept adequate CloudWatch expiry alarms or scheduled
issuer-side checks; missing EventBridge/SNS routing alone is not a gap. Where an unmet
need is demonstrated and ACM event applicability is verified, EventBridge expiry routing
is an option: inspect the enabled rule's `aws.acm` source and "ACM Certificate Approaching
Expiration" detail-type, relevant certificate scope and notification target. Rule/target
existence proves configuration, not delivery. Missing monitoring or delivery evidence stays
UNKNOWN, not absent protection. Prefer DNS validation where applicable.

ACM-requested public and private certificates may qualify for managed renewal: inspect
`RenewalEligibility`, available `RenewalSummary` status, and the issuance/management path.
`Type` or eligibility alone does not prove successful renewal. Imported certificates and
certificates issued directly through Private CA `IssueCertificate` need separate renewal
handling. Do not assume ACM expiry events for direct issuance: verify ACM representation
and documented event applicability; otherwise require issuer/deployment-side expiration
monitoring and report monitoring UNKNOWN. Missing issuance history needs manual confirmation.

**Notes:** Inspect actual `NotBefore`/`NotAfter` dates, certificate type, and current
issuer/service documentation, including [ACM certificate characteristics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-certificate-characteristics.html).
Do not assume public, private, and imported certificates share one validity period; missing
dates remain UNKNOWN. CloudFront
certificates must be issued in `us-east-1` regardless of the distribution's origin region.
Certificate Transparency logging cannot be toggled from the console, cannot change once
the renewal period starts (~60 days before expiry), and failures there are silent.

## AWS Network Firewall

These reads establish presence, logging and policy settings. Continue with the selected
[network suitability guidance](recommendation-matrix.md#focused-suitability-beyond-enablement) for deployment, HOME_NET/rule
applicability, TLS/trust suitability using focused evidence. Do not author or
execute Suricata rules, mutation recipes, scans or analyses. Configuration alone does not
prove symmetric routing, enforcement or client compatibility.

```bash
aws network-firewall list-firewalls --region <region>
aws network-firewall describe-firewall --firewall-name <name> --region <region>
aws network-firewall describe-logging-configuration --firewall-name <name> --region <region>
# Policy-level settings live on the policy, not the firewall
aws network-firewall describe-firewall-policy --firewall-policy-arn <arn> --region <region>
```

**Assessment conditions:** first establish the actual deployment mode, intended traffic
paths and compatible policy strategy (see the [matrix](recommendation-matrix.md#focused-suitability-beyond-enablement)). Assess endpoint/AZ coverage against that topology;
do not apply an inspection-VPC rule universally to native TGW or multi-endpoint designs.
Record observed rule order, stateless forwarding, default actions and logging destinations
separately from evidence of effective blocking and log delivery. Evaluate strict order,
application-aware versus custom defaults and required ALERT/FLOW visibility in that
context; do not require every drop default to have a paired alert default. Unresolved
topology, intent, compatibility or effectiveness remains UNKNOWN rather than a gap.

Assess `StreamExceptionPolicy` against application recovery requirements and existing
connection/idle-flow evidence. Recommend a change only
for a demonstrated incompatibility, with owner-reviewed planned impact and validation;
do not assert a universal firewall restart or change requirement.

## Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall

```bash
# Rule group to VPC associations — an unassociated rule group protects nothing
aws route53resolver list-firewall-rule-group-associations \
  --query 'FirewallRuleGroupAssociations[].{Vpc:VpcId,Status:Status,Priority:Priority}' \
  --region <region>

aws route53resolver list-firewall-rule-groups --region <region>

# Per-VPC fail-open setting (own design, not guide-sourced; report it, do not fail on it)
aws route53resolver get-firewall-config --resource-id <vpc-id> --region <region>

# Query logging — required for DNS threat hunting
aws route53resolver list-resolver-query-log-configs --region <region>
aws route53resolver list-resolver-query-log-config-associations \
  --query 'ResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations[].{Vpc:ResourceId,Config:ResolverQueryLogConfigId,Status:Status,Error:Error}' \
  --region <region>
```

**Pass conditions:** at least one rule group associated with each VPC; AWS-managed domain
lists attached as the first layer; DNS Firewall Advanced enabled for DNS tunneling and
domain-generation-algorithm detection; query-log association `CREATED` for the actual VPC,
with a deliberate retention policy. A query-log configuration alone does not prove VPC
coverage; retention and delivery remain UNKNOWN without separate evidence.

DNS Firewall is the earliest filter in the chain — blocking at the DNS layer stops traffic
before it reaches Network Firewall, which reduces downstream processing cost.

## AWS Firewall Manager

Relevant for distributed deployments: 10 or more accounts with per-account or per-VPC WAF,
DNS Firewall, or Network Firewall that need policy rollout and enforcement as accounts and
VPCs are added. Requires AWS Organizations and AWS Config; verify current pricing/bundling.
It adds limited value to a centralized single-firewall design.

```bash
# ResourceNotFoundException = no FMS administrator designated
aws fms get-admin-account --region us-east-1
aws fms list-policies --region us-east-1
```

**Pass conditions:** an FMS administrator account exists if the org has 10 or more accounts
with distributed firewall deployments; not required for a centralized design.

## Account-scoped coverage interpretation

For both coverage examples, substitute only the account established by caller identity,
not an account discovered through admin visibility. For an explicitly approved multi-account
set, run bounded per-account predicates and label each scope. Follow CLI auto-pagination;
no max-items/no-paginate for completeness claims. Retain successful pages and mark a failed
remainder UNKNOWN. Coverage rows are scan/coverage records, not unique workload counts.
The projections retain identifiers for scoped reconciliation; mask them in reports.
GuardDuty's resource type is nested under `ResourceDetails.ResourceType`. Inspector's
account predicate is `filterCriteria.accountId` with `comparison: EQUALS`. A client-side
projection/filter does not constrain collection. Do not use unfiltered GuardDuty coverage
statistics from a delegated administrator as evidence about the caller account; if a
verified scoped statistics request is unavailable, use the filtered list or mark UNKNOWN.

## Amazon Inspector

```bash
# Per-scan-type activation status
aws inspector2 batch-get-account-status --region <region>

# Coverage — which resources are actually being scanned
aws inspector2 list-coverage --region <region> \
  --filter-criteria '{"accountId":[{"comparison":"EQUALS","value":"<caller-account-id>"}]}' \
  --query 'coveredResources[].{Account:accountId,Resource:resourceId,Type:resourceType,ScanType:scanType,Status:scanStatus}'

# Organization posture
aws inspector2 list-delegated-admin-accounts --region <region>
aws inspector2 describe-organization-configuration --region <region>
# ONLY when detailed account-level enumeration is explicitly requested.
aws inspector2 list-members \
  --query 'members[].{Id:accountId,Status:relationshipStatus}' --region <region>
```

`batch-get-account-status` returns `resourceState` per scan type. Valid types: `EC2`,
`ECR`, `LAMBDA`, `LAMBDA_CODE`, `CODE_REPOSITORY`.

`LAMBDA` and `LAMBDA_CODE` are separate toggles and the guide says both should be on —
`LAMBDA` covers package vulnerabilities, `LAMBDA_CODE` covers custom application code.

`CODE_REPOSITORY` is Inspector Code Security (repository SAST, SCA, and IaC scanning).
A confirmed repository or CI/CD use case selects the [matrix guidance](recommendation-matrix.md#focused-suitability-beyond-enablement),
with focused integration/language/gate evidence and an AppSec handoff. Account inventory
alone neither triggers this recommendation nor establishes absence of repositories.

```bash
# ECR rescan duration and EC2 scan mode.
# Returns ecrConfiguration.rescanDurationState and ec2Configuration.scanModeState.
aws inspector2 get-configuration --region <region>

# Deep Inspection is a separate API, not part of get-configuration.
# Returns status, packagePaths (up to 5 per account), orgPackagePaths (up to 5 more).
aws inspector2 get-ec2-deep-inspection-configuration --region <region>
```

Valid `EcrRescanDuration` values: `LIFETIME`, `DAYS_3`, `DAYS_7`, `DAYS_14`, `DAYS_30`,
`DAYS_60`, `DAYS_90`, `DAYS_180`.

**Pass conditions:** every scan type with corresponding resources is `ENABLED`;
`autoEnable` covers new member accounts; EC2 scanning on Enhanced EC2 Scanning (the VM
Scanner), with a legacy SSM-plugin setup flagged as a migration finding; Deep Inspection on
(Linux, Windows, and macOS with Enhanced EC2 Scanning) and custom paths reviewed against
where software is actually installed; ECR rescan durations match build cadence (a cost lever
only for standalone Inspector).

## Amazon Macie

```bash
# Not enabled returns AccessDeniedException — no distinct "not enabled" error
aws macie2 get-macie-session --region <region>

# Automated discovery is the guide's default recommendation over discovery jobs
aws macie2 get-automated-discovery-configuration --region <region>

# Discovery results repository — results retained only 90 days, configure within 30
aws macie2 get-classification-export-configuration --region <region>

# Findings publication — by default only policy findings go to Security Hub CSPM
aws macie2 get-findings-publication-configuration --region <region>

# Organization posture
aws macie2 list-organization-admin-accounts --region <region>
aws macie2 describe-organization-configuration --region <region>
# ONLY when detailed account-level enumeration is explicitly requested.
aws macie2 list-members --only-associated false \
  --query 'members[].{Id:accountId,Status:relationshipStatus}' --region <region>
```

**Pass conditions:** session `ENABLED`; automated sensitive data discovery `ENABLED`;
classification export configured to an S3 bucket;
`securityHubConfiguration.publishClassificationFindings` is `true` (the guide calls
publishing sensitive data findings its highest-value configuration change, because Security
Hub exposure scoring and GuardDuty attack sequences use the sensitive-data trait);
`autoEnable` on for new org accounts.

**Coverage limits:** Macie monitors up to 10,000 general purpose buckets per account and
coverage stops at that ceiling. Buckets whose policy carries an explicit deny need the Macie
service-linked role allowed before they can be scanned; the resource coverage page lists
them.

## Amazon Detective

```bash
# Empty list = not enabled
aws detective list-graphs --region <region>

aws detective list-organization-admin-accounts --region <region>
aws detective describe-organization-configuration --graph-arn <arn> --region <region>
# ONLY when detailed account-level enumeration is explicitly requested.
aws detective list-members --graph-arn <arn> \
  --query 'MemberDetails[].{Id:AccountId,Status:Status}' --region <region>
```

**Eligibility:** the guide states GuardDuty is a prerequisite. Verify current Detective
eligibility before treating that claim as mandatory; if unavailable, report eligibility
UNKNOWN. Preserve the GuardDuty findings integration, but do not recommend extra enablement
solely to satisfy an unverified gate. This does not establish that the prerequisite was removed.

**Pass conditions:** graph exists; auto-enable on; GuardDuty finding publishing frequency
set to 15 minutes (the 6-hour default delays recurring-finding updates in Detective by up
to 6 hours, and tightening it costs nothing); source packages for AWS security findings
and EKS audit logs enabled — older deployments must turn these on manually; where Security
Lake is also in use, the Detective integration lets investigators pull the underlying logs
with a pre-built Athena query.

**Quota:** a behavior graph supports a maximum of 1200 accounts.

## Amazon Security Lake

```bash
aws securitylake list-data-lakes --regions <region>
# get-data-lake-sources filters by account, not region
aws securitylake get-data-lake-sources --accounts <account-id>
aws securitylake list-log-sources --regions <region>
aws securitylake get-data-lake-organization-configuration
aws securitylake get-data-lake-exception-subscription
```

Valid `AwsLogSourceName` values: `CLOUD_TRAIL_MGMT`, `VPC_FLOW`, `ROUTE53`,
`SH_FINDINGS`, `EKS_AUDIT`, `S3_DATA`, `LAMBDA_EXECUTION`, `WAF`.

The guide recommends enabling all **default** sources: `CLOUD_TRAIL_MGMT`, `EKS_AUDIT`,
`ROUTE53`, `SH_FINDINGS`, `VPC_FLOW`. Treat `S3_DATA`, `LAMBDA_EXECUTION`, and `WAF` as
opt-in — they are excluded by default for high volume and cost.

**Prerequisite:** `CLOUD_TRAIL_MGMT` collection requires an existing multi-region
organization trail capturing read and write management events.

**Delegated admin placement:** the Log Archive account, not the security tooling account
used by the other five services.

**Pass conditions:** data lake exists; all five default sources on; new-account
collection enabled; if rollup regions are configured, contributing-region retention matches
verified investigation and recovery needs.

## IAM Access Analyzer

```bash
# External-access analyzers cover supported resources in their region
aws accessanalyzer list-analyzers --region <region>
aws accessanalyzer list-findings --analyzer-arn <arn> --region <region>
```

Analyzer `type` values: `ACCOUNT`, `ORGANIZATION`, `ACCOUNT_UNUSED_ACCESS`,
`ORGANIZATION_UNUSED_ACCESS`, `ACCOUNT_INTERNAL_ACCESS`, `ORGANIZATION_INTERNAL_ACCESS`.

These are distinct analyzers, not one analyzer with modes. An account can have an
unused-access analyzer and still have no external-access analyzer — check the `type`
field rather than treating any active analyzer as coverage. Security Hub may create an
unused-access analyzer automatically (named `_AccessAnalyzerForSecurityHub*`), which is
why "an analyzer exists" is not sufficient evidence of external-access coverage.

**Pass conditions:** at least one analyzer of type `ACCOUNT` or `ORGANIZATION` for
external access in each relevant region; an `*_UNUSED_ACCESS` analyzer if the org reviews
unused permissions, without duplicating it per region. Verify internal-access scope
separately before judging coverage.

## AWS Config

Check this only when Security Hub CSPM runs **standalone**. When unified Security Hub and
CSPM are both enabled, CSPM creates and manages the service-linked recorder
`AWSConfigurationRecorderForSecurityHubCSPM` in each account and region, keeps its scope
aligned to the controls, does not use your customer-managed recorder, and `Config.1` always
passes. In that state a missing customer-managed recorder or delivery channel is not a gap.

```bash
aws configservice describe-configuration-recorders --region <region>
aws configservice describe-configuration-recorder-status --region <region>
aws configservice describe-delivery-channels --region <region>
aws configservice describe-configuration-aggregators --region <region>
```

**Pass conditions (standalone CSPM):** recorder exists, `recording` is `true`, and `lastStatus` is `SUCCESS`;
delivery channel configured; recording group covers the resource types the enabled standards
evaluate; global resources recorded in one region only (the guide's duplication-avoidance
practice). The guide's standalone cost levers: record global resources in one region, turn
off the compliance history timeline if Config serves only CSPM, and be cautious scoping the
recorder down, since new controls arrive regularly. Whichever recorder is in play, CSPM emits
`WARNING` findings for controls whose resource type is not being recorded; treat those as the
safety net.

## Summary table to produce

Summarize relationships/counts with masked identifiers unless detail was explicitly
requested. Projections are not disclosure permission; apply parent raw-output and
sensitive-field exclusions. Unrequested member detail is NOT ASSESSED.
